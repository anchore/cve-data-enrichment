In Admidio before version 4.3.10, there is a Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in the Message module of the Admidio Application, where it is possible to upload a PHP file in the attachment. The uploaded file can be accessed publicly through the URL `{admidio_base_url}/adm_my_files/messages_attachments/{file_name}`.
