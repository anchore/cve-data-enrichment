    "description": "Authenticator is a browser extensions that generates two-step verification codes. In versions 7.0.0 and below, encryption keys for user data were stored encrypted at-rest using only AES-256 and the EVP_BytesToKey KDF. Therefore, attackers with a copy of a user's data are able to brute-force the user's encryption key. Users on version 8.0.0 and above are automatically migrated away from the weak encoding on first login. Users should destroy encrypted backups made with versions prior to 8.0.0.",
    "reason": "Added CPE configurations because not yet analyzed by NVD.",
