    "description": "The The Ultimate WordPress Toolkit – WP Extended plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.8 via the duplicate_post function due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to duplicate posts written by other authors including admins. This includes the ability to duplicate password-protected posts, which reveals their contents.",
