    "cveId": "CVE-2024-47122",
    "description": "In the goTenna Pro application, the encryption keys are stored along with a static IV on the device. This allows for complete decryption of keys stored on the device. This allows an attacker to decrypt all encrypted communications that include P2P, Group, and broadcast messages that use these keys.",
    "reason": "Added CPE configurations because not yet analyzed by NVD.",

      "goTenna recommends that users mitigate these vulnerabilities by performing the following updates:\n\n  *  Android Pro: v2.0.3 or greater\n  *  iOS Pro users please contact goTenna so they can push this update directly to users.\n\n\ngoTenna recommends that users follow these mitigations:\n\nGeneral Mitigations for All Users/Clients * Use Discreet Callsigns and Key Names: Choose callsigns and key names that do not disclose sensitive information, such as your location, team size, or team name. Avoid using any identifiers that could inadvertently reveal your location or the composition of your team. * Secure End-User Devices: Implement strong security measures on all end-user devices, including the use of encryption and ensuring regular software updates. * Follow Key Rotation Best Practices: Regularly rotate encryption keys according to industry best practices to maintain ongoing security.\n\nPro-Specific Mitigations * Share Encryption Keys via QR Code: Utilize QR codes, similar to ATAK, for the secure exchange of encryption keys. * Secure Broadcasting: When broadcasting, ensure you are in a secured area and transmit the key at a reduced power of 0.5 Watts to limit exposure.\n\n  *  Leverage Layered Encryption: Implement layered encryption keys to securely manage communications, whether interacting with individuals or teams.\n\n\nIf you have any questions please contact prosupport@gotenna.com."
