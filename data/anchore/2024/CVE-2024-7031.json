    "description": "The File Manager Pro – Filester plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'njt_fs_saveSettingRestrictions' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.8.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with a role that has been granted permissions by an Administrator, to update the plugin settings for user role restrictions, including allowing file types such as .php to be uploaded.",
