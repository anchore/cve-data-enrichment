    "description": "VNote is a note-taking platform. A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in the Markdown rendering functionality of versions 3.18.1 and prior of the VNote note-taking application. This vulnerability allows the injection and execution of arbitrary JavaScript code through which remote code execution can be achieved. A patch for this issue is available at commit f1af78573a0ef51d6ef6a0bc4080cddc8f30a545. Other mitigation strategies include implementing rigorous input sanitization for all Markdown content and utilizing a secure Markdown parser that appropriately escapes or strips potentially dangerous content.",
