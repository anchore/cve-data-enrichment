    "description": "The Media Library Assistant plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation involving the mla-inline-edit-upload-scripts AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 3.18. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.",
