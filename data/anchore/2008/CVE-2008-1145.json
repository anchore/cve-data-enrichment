    "description": "Directory traversal vulnerability in WEBrick in Ruby 1.8 before 1.8.5-p115 and 1.8.6-p114, and 1.9 through 1.9.0-1, when running on systems that support backslash (\\) path separators or case-insensitive file names, allows remote attackers to access arbitrary files via (1) \"..%5c\" (encoded backslash) sequences or (2) filenames that match patterns in the :NondisclosureName option.",
    "reason": "Improved CPE configurations.  This old version of WEBrick embedded in old ruby versions was not versioned properly, so just report the vuln as against ruby itself.",
